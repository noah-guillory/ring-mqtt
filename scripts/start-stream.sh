# This script is intended for use only with ring-mqtt
# and go2rtc.
#
# Requires mosquitto MQTT clients package to be installed
# Uses ring-mqtt internal IPC broker for communication with
# ring-mqtt process
#
# Spawns stream control in background due to issues with
# process exit hanging go2rtc.  Script then just monitors
# for control script to exit or, if script is killed,
# sends commands to control script prior to exiting

# Required command line arguments
device_id=${1}     # Camera device Id
type=${2}          # Stream type ("live"/"event"/"snapshot")
base_topic=${3}    # Command topic for Camera entity
rtsp_pub_url=${4}  # URL for publishing RTSP stream
client_id="${device_id}_${type}"  # Id used to connect to the MQTT broker, camera Id + event type

# If previous run hasn't exited yet, just perform a short wait and exit with error
